# Metascraper PHP

Metascraper PHP is a work-in-progress PHP reimplementation of the [microlinkhq/metascraper](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper) library. It allows you to easily scrape metadata from websites using Open Graph metadata, HTML metadata and a series of fallbacks.

The goal is to have a fully compatible output with the [microlinkhq/metascraper](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper) library.

This is very early work-in-progress, so the structure and API of the project is still not stable.
